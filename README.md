Ascaris Microbiome

The complex interactions between parasites, their hosts, and associated microbiota hold significant implications for host health and disease outcomes. Helminths like Ascaris lumbricoides and Ascaris suum can significantly alter the host's intestinal microbiota, affecting both parasite biology and host pathology. Despite extensive research on host microbiota changes due to helminth infections, the study of helminth-associated microbiota remains limited. This study aims to contribute to filling this gap by characterizing the microbiota associated with various developmental stages of Ascaris and examining its impact on the host's microbiota during larval migration in a murine model. Utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed bacterial diversity in samples from different Ascaris stages and host tissues.

Our results revealed a total of 8,040 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with Ascaris samples displaying the highest diversity. Notably, Ascaris-associated microbiota differed significantly from that of the host, with higher diversity observed in the parasite, particularly during larval migration. Differential abundance analysis identified distinct taxonomic patterns across sample groups, highlighting specific genera such as Bradyrhizobium, Achromobacter, and Pseudomonas in Ascaris. In host organs, the liver and lung microbiota exhibited distinct profiles dominated by Proteobacteria.

This study underscores the intricate interplay between Ascaris and host microbiota, revealing organ-specific microbial signatures and potential interactions. Our findings suggest that Ascaris harbors a unique microbiota that potentially exchanges bacteria with the host during larval migration. These insights pave the way for further research into the ecological and functional dynamics of helminth-microbiota interactions, which may inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting these microbial relationships to mitigate helminth infections and improve host health outcomes.
